K-Means Clustering:
    *Attempts to split data into K groups that are closet to K centroids
    *Unsupervised learning 
    *Used to find interesting groupings of people/things/behaviour

    How it works:
        *Randomly picks K centroids (k-means)
        *Assign the data points which centroid its closest too
        *Recompute the centroids based on the average of the data nearest too it
        *Keep going through the data once the points consistently match to the same centroid
    
    Limitations:
        *Choosing a K value, increasing the value until you stop getting large reductions in squared error
        *Avoiding local minima:
            *Clustering focuses on local instead of global
        *Labeling the clusters
            *Finding the relationship is hard
