SVM:
    *Works well with higher-dimensional data (tons of features)
    *Divides the large amount of data (features) by dividng them into support vectors
    *Use a "kernel trick" to represent the data in high dimensional spaces to find hyper planes that aren't apparent in lower dimensions
    *In short, use them when you have a lot of features
    *Supervised learning
