Decision Tree:
    *Construct a flowchart to help you decide a classification for something with machine learning
    *Form of supervised learning
    *layers of modeling

    Ex:
        *Hiring decision Tree
        *Database of historical hiring Database
        *Determines whether a candidate gets hired or not
        Ex Tree:
                                                                            Did an Internship
                                                                N: Currently Employed       Y: hired
                                            N: Less than one employer Y: hired
                                N: Attend a top school      Y Dont Hire
                            N: Don't hire  Y: Hire    

        *At Ezch step find attribute we can use to partiiton the data set to minimize the entropy of the data
        *Greedy Algo:
            *As it goes down the tree it picks the decision that reduces entropy

    *Issue is that they are prone to overfitting
        *Combat this by constructing alternate decision trees to help decide (Random Forests)
            *Random Forests are an example of Ensemble learning
                *Using multiple models to work together
