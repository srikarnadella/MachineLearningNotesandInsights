Machine Learning: Algorithms that can learn from observational data and can make predictions (Linear regression)

Unsupervised Learning: 
    *Model is not given answers to learn from (aka no Y)
    *Trying to let the model to figure it out on its own
    *Useful if you don't know what you are looking for as the model can find different relations
    *Clustering


Supervised Learning:
    *Algo learns as it has the correct answers
    *Used to predict values (Car price prediction)

    Train and Test:
        *Good way to test Supervised Learning
        *You split your data into train and test (80% train)
        *Good to prevent OVERFITTING
        *SPLIT NEEDS TO BE RANDOMLY SELECTED
        *Data sets need to large to ensure that it is representative

        K-fold Cross validation:
            *Repeatedly doing train and test with multiple samples
            *Essentially shuffling the train and test data to make sure that is versatile
